Theme-Neon
==========

A Sublime Text UI Theme to go with my [Neon Color Scheme](https://github.com/MattDMo/Neon-sublime-theme). Originally based on the [Nexus Theme](https://github.com/EleazarCrusader/nexus-theme), which was itself based on a bunch of previous ones. Basically, a big thank you to anyone who has designed a theme and posted it on [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/browse/labels/theme) &mdash; I may have borrowed an idea or two from you.
